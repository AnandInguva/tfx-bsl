# `tfx_bsl` release notes

## Release 0.15.2

*   Added a (beam) utility to infer column types from a `PCollection[CSVLine]`.
*   Added a utility to parse a CSVLine into cells (conforming to RFC4180)

### Bug Fixes and Other Changes

### Breaking Changes

### Deprecations

## Release 0.15.1

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Added dependency on `tensorflow>=1.15,<2.2`. Starting from 1.15, package
    `tensorflow` comes with GPU support. Users won't need to choose between
    `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-gpu`.
    *   Caveat: `tensorflow` 2.0.0 is an exception and does not have GPU
        support. If `tensorflow-gpu` 2.0.0 is installed before installing
        `tfx-bsl`, it will be replaced with `tensorflow` 2.0.0. Re-install
        `tensorflow-gpu` 2.0.0 if needed.
*   Added dependency on `tensorflow-serving-api>=1.15,<3`.
*   Added a python PTransform, `tfx_bsl.beam.RunInference` that enables batch
    inference.
