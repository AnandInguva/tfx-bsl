# This should have been simply an invocation of "auditwheel repair" but because

# TFDV depends on are treated incorrectly by auditwheel. We have to do this
# trick to make auditwheel happily stamp on our wheel.

# it's still manylinux2010 compliant according to the standard, because it only
# depends on the specified shared libraries, assuming pyarrow is installed.
